Warewulf v4.5.6 includes a significant fix for overlay autobuild, resolving a bug in v4.5.5 that caused autobuilt overlays to be empty. We've also added tab completion for the remaining subcommands of `wwctl overlay`, and simplified the `wwctl container list` command to break-out size calculations as optional and only report one type of size at a time. (Previously, container size was reported as the sum of the chroot, the uncompressed archive, and the compressed archive.)

The full changelog is below:

# Added

- Show more information during `wwctl container <shell|exec>` about when and if the container image will be rebuilt. #1302
- Command-line completion for `wwctl overlay <edit|delete|chmod|chown>`. #1298
- Display an error during boot if no container is defined. #1295
- `wwctl conatiner list --kernel` shows the kernel detected for each container. #1283
- `wwctl container list --size` shows the uncompressed size of each container. `--compressed` shows the compressed size, and `--chroot` shows the size of the container source on the server. #954, #1117
- Add a logrotate config for `warewulfd.log`. #1311

# Fixed

- Ensure autobuilt overlays include contextual overlay contents. #1296
- Fix the failure when updating overlay files existing on different partitions. #1312
- Escape asset tag for `wwclient` query strings when pulling runtime overlays. #1310

# Changed

- `wwctl container list` only lists names by default. (`--long` shows all attributes.) #1117

- `-y` option to skip "Are you sure" queries
- `wwctl kernel delete` command
- `wwctl vnfs` alias for `wwctl container`
- Support for authenticated OCI registries
- warewulfd can reload config on SIGHUP and when the config file changes
- Node database index to improve lookup speeds
- Kernels and containers can be imported from a chroot subdirectory
- Systemd service file

### Changed
- `wwctl node list` output beautification
- Log timestamps are more precise
- PID file and log files are now in `/var/run` and `/var/log`, respectively
- `make install` no longer overwrites preexisting configuration files
- Kernel modules and overlays are now compressed

- dhcpd template now references correct wwctl subcommand
- `wwctl node set kernelargs` and `wwctl profile set kernelargs` change kernel arguments

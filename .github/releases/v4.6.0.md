- new configuration upgrade system
- changes to the default profile
- renaming containers to (node) images
- new kernel management system
- parallel overlay builds
- sprig functions in overlay templates
- improved network overlays
- nested profiles
- arbitrary "resources" data in nodes.conf

Additional changes not impacting the user interface are listed in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

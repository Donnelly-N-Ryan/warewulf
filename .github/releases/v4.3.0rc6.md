This is hopefully the last release candidate before the 4.3.0 release which is scheduled for next week (June 15th, 2022).

In this RC is a substantial fix for making server side overlay building thread safe (thanks @kcdodd!) and some other small cleanups and additions to get into the 4.3.0 main release.
